<h1>Welcome to Penguin's Flash Games</h1>
<h3>Since flash games are amazing, I decided to make a webpage with a few of them archived.</h3>
<h3><i>-Copyright Disclaimer-</i>I do not own any of these games. I didn't create any of these games. The original creators will be given credit on the listing of their game, and at the bottom of the page.<h3>
<h3>Also, since Flash is gone, if you can't run it, then you can download the swf files from links in the page, and running them in any swf file reader.</h3>

<h1>Since flash got taken out of web browsers, you should click the download links and play them in an swf file player.</h1>
<h1>I personally think the Newgrounds flash player is the best, especially because if you go to Newgrounds, it will launch the flash games/movies in the flash player if you have it.</h1>
