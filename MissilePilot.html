<p>The way the game works is you fly a missile through obstacles to get to the end of a level. You go through several levels, and if you touch an obstacle, you have to go back to the beginning. Some levels are easy, and some are hard. That isn't a design choice though, it's because I kind of suck at making levels.</p>
