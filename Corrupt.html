<p>Corrupt is a video game that I am making. It is meant to be similar to games such as Doom (1993), Quake, Ion Fury, and Maximum Action. What do all of these games have in common, A, they are all retro games (except for Maximum Action, and Ion Fury, much like my game, is a modern game meant to be like 90's shooter games), and they all have fast-paced shooting action. Corrupt is meant to be similar to these old 90's shooter games.</p>
